# fluid text
## what is a fluid text
- from what i see, fluid text is the gathering of other versions of the reading compared side by side
    - like manuscript pages
## how does fluid text help understand a text
- original ideas compared to the final
    - you can see what the author wanted to express if the final product is vague
