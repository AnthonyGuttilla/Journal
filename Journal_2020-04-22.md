# text encoding
## Metareading
- using different versions of a text to best determine author's intent
- using the text as a guide to learn about who wrote it and why, to find out what the text means.
## TEI
    - Text Encoding Initiative
        - a language mixing code and text
- Looking at a text through code
- breaks down sections of a text by title, paragraph, line, chapter, ect. 
    - < l > = line
    - < lg > = line group
        - types of lg
            - free
            - quatrain
            - stanza
## adding fluid text to metareading
- we can compare versions of a text next to each other and use TEI to find the differences easy and spot the proper intentions of a author through the different texts
